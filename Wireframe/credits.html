<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

It is very important to think about the security measures of your website, particulary a site like Chollerton Tearoom
that handles
user data. In it's current state, the Chollerton Tearooms website solely requests basic yet valuable data off customers
like their
email, contact numbers, address however in later stages if the website were to take payments off user for actions like
booking
rooms then the website's security needs to be upgrade. Firstly, the website
would need to change the way it gets the information like swap the POST methodology within the php script. Currently, it
uses GET method
which shows the information typed in by a user in the website's URL.

Another issue we would need to consider would be the threats and attacks like SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting.
SQL Injection is the one of the most common attacks in any websites and it involves inserting malicious code to alter or
even
get access the database. This is very dangerous as hackers can manipulate the database or even worse exploit it to get
sensitive user
details like their banking details causing serious issues like identity theft. This means we are responsible for
ultimately
violating the Data Protection Law set by the GDPR.
<br>

<!-- This is how to prevent it  -->
<h2>Minimising any potential Security Risks</h2>
A security feature that might be helpful to invest would be SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and it is a common
security technology that establishes an encrypted link between the server and the user therefore making it
secure. This allows the user to put any banking details or any sensitive information securely as it encrypts
those details rather than sending the data to admin in plain text. As for cross-scripting, Chollerton Tearoom can
implement
a XSS filter and use functions like htmlspecialchars() and real_escape_string() in our PHP Script. Of Course, any
attacks can be
avoided by providing user awareness for the Chollerton management team where we alert about security issues, important
of updates,
have a strong password policy for any logins, encrypt data implementing SSL, turn on the firewall for web security,
install
Adblock to avoid any ads, mails, pish emails as well as provide training for their users.
